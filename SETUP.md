## Testing Exercises

If you followed the [installation instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/factor#installing), just run the provided test suite against your implementation with `"exercise-name" test`.

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/factor/exercise-name` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.factor` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit exercism/factor/bob/bob.factor`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
