# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Testing Exercises

If you followed the [installation instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/factor/installation), just run the provided test suite against your implementation with `"exercise-name" test`.

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/factor/exercise-name` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.factor` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit exercism/factor/bob/bob.factor`.
