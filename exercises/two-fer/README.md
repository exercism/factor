# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

```
"One for X, one for me."
```

When X is a name or "you".

If the given name is "Alice", the result should be "One for Alice, one for me."
If no name is given, the result should be "One for you, one for me."


## Test-Driven Development

As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Here at Exercism we simulate [Test-Driven
Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), where
you write your tests before writing any functionality. The simulation comes in
the form of a pre-written test suite, which will signal that you have solved
the problem.

It will also provide you with a safety net to explore other solutions without
breaking the functionality.

### A typical TDD workflow on Exercism:

1. Run the test file and pick one test that's failing.
2. Write some code to fix the test you picked.
3. Re-run the tests to confirm the test is now passing.
4. Repeat from step 1.
5. Submit your solution (`exercism submit /path/to/file`)

## Instructions

Submissions are encouraged to be general, within reason. Having said that, it's
also important not to over-engineer a solution.

It's important to remember that the goal is to make code as expressive and
readable as we can.

## Testing Exercises

If you followed the [installation instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/factor/installation), just run the provided test suite against your implementation with `"exercise-name" test`.

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/factor/exercise-name` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.factor` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit exercism/factor/bob/bob.factor`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/factor).

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
